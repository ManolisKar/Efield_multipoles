# Multipole expansion of quadrupole field

## Introduction

The quadrupole plates generate the E-field experienced by the muons in the Muon g-2 experiment. 
They consist of 4 sets (Q1-Q4), each with a short and long segment, for a total of 8 quadrupole sections (Q1S, Q1L, Q2S, ...). There are 4 plates in each section: top, bottom, inner, outer.

After performing the in-situ [alignment surveys](https://github.com/ManolisKar/ProximitySensors) that characterized the location of individual plates better than ever before, I proceeded to model the E-field generated by these plates given their deviation from design (ideal) location.
For that I performed [Finite Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) modeling using the [OPERA-3D](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/opera/) software -- their support team was very responsive and helpful.
